We created a **News App** that supports **CRUD operations**:  
- **ADD** news to the application  
- **READ** news articles  
- **UPDATE** existing news  
- **DELETE** news items  

The application also supports **user registration**. Registered users can **log in** to their accounts. All the **news data** and **user data** is securely stored in **MongoDB**.  
<br>

### **Additional Features**  
- **Version Control**: The application includes version control to track changes in every file.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The UI is designed for simplicity, ensuring all CRUD operations are intuitive and accessible.  
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Features like a **HEADER** and **FOOTER** simplify navigation and improve the overall user experience.
